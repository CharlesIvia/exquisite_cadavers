# WANT: Creaate monte carlo generator that can construct sensible lines of poetry
# This idea is inspired by Fooled by Randomness, a book by Nasim Taleb

# "On a folded piece of paper, in turn, each of the five people would write a predetermined
# part of a sentence, not knowing the othersâ€™ choice. The first
# would pick an adjective, the second a noun, the third a verb, the
# fourth an adjective, and the fifth a noun."

# Some of the interesting lines of poetry formed:

# A whining customer service can crash a flaky happiness.
# A tight law can squash the happy riches.
# The helpful childhood might handle the sweet warmth.
# The mango warmth could wriggle the worried time.
# The weak wealth shall program the elegant adventure.
# An alive pleasure will vanish a scary silver.
# A deafening loss was tease a raspy awe.
# A shrilling love can preach the vast luck.
# The flat silver will lighten the fancy time.
# A massive tolerance can seal the eager surprise.
# A tight compassion has found a deep tiredness.
# The helpful shopping might pat a calm artisty.
# The melodic relaxation shall grip a ashy ability.
# An agreeable pasta might confuse the quiet talent.
# A loose power can melt the noisy courage.
# A scruffy bread might screw the careful pasta.
# The most disquiet shall tremble a deep fascination.
# The yellow gold shall sprout a modern awe.
# The prickly amazement will sail a greasy strictness.
