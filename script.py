# WANT: Creaate monte carlo generator that can construct sensible lines of poetry
# This idea is inspired by Fooled by Randomness, a book by Nasim Taleb

# "On a folded piece of paper, in turn, each one of them would write a predetermined
# part of a sentence, not knowing the othersâ€™ choice. The first
# would pick an adjective, the second a noun, the third a verb, the
# fourth an adjective, and the fifth a noun."

# Import required libraries
